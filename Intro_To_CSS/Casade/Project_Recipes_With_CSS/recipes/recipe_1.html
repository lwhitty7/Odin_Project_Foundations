    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (8 to 10 ounces each)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves, garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced shallots or onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest, plus more to garnish</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced red bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions on How to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wilt spinach in a large pot over medium-high heat. As soon as the spinach turns green, quickly transfer to a strainer and squeeze out most of the water. Transfer to a cutting board and roughly chop. Reserve until needed.</li>
        <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper, and coat evenly all over with the flour. </li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a nonstick pan, and heat over medium-high heat. Place chicken in, and once breasts are sizzling in the oil, reduce heat to medium. Cook breasts until just cooked through and a golden brown crust has formed, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Turn off heat and reserve.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and butter to the pan you plan to serve chicken in (see Chefâ€™s Note). Turn heat to medium-high, and once butter melts, add garlic, shallots, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add wine, and cook, stirring, until the wine reduces by half, a few minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add lemon zest and red peppers, and cook, stirring for another few minutes. Stir in cream, and bring mixture up to a simmer. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Once cream simmers for a few minutes, and begins to reduce and thicken slightly, reduce heat to medium and stir in wilted spinach until evenly combined with cream sauce.</li>
        <li>Place chicken back into the pan, and simmer on medium, until chicken is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and another light grating of lemon zest.</li>
    </ol>
