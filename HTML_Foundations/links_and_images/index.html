    <!-- The new atributes are as follows -->
    <!-- target = "_blank" - This tells the program where the link should be opened wether it should be in a the same webpage which is how it is without the tag otherwise known as target = "_self" -->
    <!-- rel = This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document -->

    <!-- While the new values are as follows -->
    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. -->
    <!-- The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. -->


    <!-- good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer". -->
